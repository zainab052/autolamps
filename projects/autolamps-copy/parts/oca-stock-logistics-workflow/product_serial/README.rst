==============
Product Serial
==============

This module improves the usability of serial numbers in Odoo. It is very usefull when you purchase and/or sell products with one serial number per item.

Configuration
=============

This module adds a new selection field *Lot Split Type* on the product form
under the *Inventory* tab ; you should set it to *Single* on products that have
one serial number per item.

Usage
=====

On the transfer wizard, for the products with *Lot Split Type* = *Single*, you will automatically get one line per unit (i.e. if the stock move has qty = 3, you will get 3 lines with qty = 1).

This module also adds a button *Spread Serial Numbers* on the transfer wizard which make it easy to create a sequence of serial numbers or import serial numbers from a file.
